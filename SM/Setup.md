How to connect the module to the Wifi
The Station Module will automatically try to connect to the last known good Wifi. If it cannot connect, it will restart itself and set up an Access Point called AUM_Station_Module. The AP has a captive portal, so anytime you connect, you will be redirected to the config page. This mode can also be accessed at any time by holding down the “logout” button for a few seconds while cycling power or doing a reset.
